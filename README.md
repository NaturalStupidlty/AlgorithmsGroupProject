## Glossary

- complex number - a number that has real and imaginary parts a + ib.
- real - real part of a complex number.
- imaginary - imaginary part of a complex number.
- matrix (also referred as complex matrix) - is a rectangular array or table of numbers NxM, in our case contains complex numbers.
- zero matrix - NxM matrix each element is zero, in our case contains complex numbers.
- identity matrix - NxN matrix each element is zero except main diagonal where elements are 1, in our case contains complex numbers.
- transposed matrix - is found by interchanging its rows into columns or columns into rows.
- Strassen's algorithm - named after Volker Strassen, is an algorithm for matrix multiplication. It is faster than the standard matrix multiplication algorithm for large matrices, with a better asymptotic complexity, although the naive algorithm is often better for smaller matrices. 
- Gauss-Jordan matrix inversion method - Gaussian elimination, also known as row reduction, is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. It consists of a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. 
- LU-decomposition matrix inversion method - lower–upper (LU) decomposition or factorization factors a matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix (see matrix decomposition). In our case it also includes Permutations matrix.
- linear regression -  is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.
- MSE - mean squared error of an estimator (of a procedure for estimating an unobserved quantity) measures the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.
