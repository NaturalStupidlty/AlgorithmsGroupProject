\item complex number -\/ a number that has real and imaginary parts a + ib.
\item real -\/ real part of a complex number.
\item imaginary -\/ imaginary part of a complex number.
\item matrix (also referred as complex matrix) -\/ is a rectangular array or table of numbers NxM, in our case contains complex numbers.
\item zero matrix -\/ NxM matrix each element is zero, in our case contains complex numbers.
\item identity matrix -\/ NxN matrix each element is zero except main diagonal where elements are 1, in our case contains complex numbers.
\item transposed matrix -\/ is found by interchanging its rows into columns or columns into rows.
\item Strassen\textquotesingle{}s algorithm -\/ named after Volker Strassen, is an algorithm for matrix multiplication. It is faster than the standard matrix multiplication algorithm for large matrices, with a better asymptotic complexity, although the naive algorithm is often better for smaller matrices.
\item Gauss-\/\+Jordan matrix inversion method -\/ Gaussian elimination, also known as row reduction, is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. It consists of a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients.
\item LU-\/decomposition matrix inversion method -\/ lower–upper (LU) decomposition or factorization factors a matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix (see matrix decomposition). In our case it also includes Permutations matrix.
\item linear regression -\/ is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.
\item MSE -\/ mean squared error of an estimator (of a procedure for estimating an unobserved quantity) measures the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.
